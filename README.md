Bio-Root
========

The Bio-Root distribution, implements a set of modules that assume nothing about
the object. They are meant to implement some coherence between the various
BioPerl modules and should be inherited by all Bioperl compliant interfaces,
even if they are exotic XS/CORBA/Other perl systems.

This distribution is part of the [BioPerl](http://www.bioperl.org/) project.
